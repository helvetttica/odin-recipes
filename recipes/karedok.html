        Karedok is a traditional Sundanese raw vegetable salad originating from West Java, Indonesia. It features thinly sliced or shredded vegetables like raw long beans, cabbage, bean sprouts, and cucumber, often mixed with tofu and tempeh. The dish is brought together by a distinctive peanut sauce, which is typically made from peanuts, chili peppers, garlic, kaempferia galanga (known as kencur in Indonesia), palm sugar, and tamarind. The ingredients are usually pounded together using a mortar and pestle, creating a vibrant and flavorful dressing that coats the fresh vegetables. Karedok is usually served with rice cakes (lontong) or plain rice and is often garnished with kerupuk (crackers) for added texture. It's a healthy, refreshing, and distinctly Indonesian dish.
